# Changelog

Notable changes to Soundpad Web. Versions follow the website's `package.json`; the Windows companion is versioned separately and only needs updating when a release says so.

## 2.6.0 — Better live transcripts, selection handles

**Update the Windows companion** for the transcript fix; the website works with 2.5 companions.

### Changed

- Live transcripts now wait for the speaker to pause (0.4 s) instead of cutting every few seconds. Streaming Voice Replay Studio's JFK test recording through Mimic in real time used to give "And so my fellow Americans ask not **to**…", with a word Whisper invented at the cut. It now gives the exact sentence, the same as transcribing the whole file. After 15 s of unbroken speech it still cuts, holding back the unfinished sentence.

### Added

- Edge handles on a Mimic selection, as in Voice Replay Studio: drag either end to adjust it without starting over. The cursor changes over a handle.
- `SoundpadWeb.Harness.exe --mimic-stream-transcript <wav>`: end-to-end live transcription check with the real Whisper engine and no audio device.
- Tests: pause-based chunking (C#), handle dragging (e2e).

## 2.5.1 — Mimic keyboard shortcuts

Website update; the companion is rebuilt as 2.5.1 with no code changes, so a 2.5.0 companion keeps working.

### Added

- Keyboard shortcuts in the Mimic window, the browser version of Voice Replay Studio's F6: **3**, **5** or **0** select the last 3, 5 or 10 seconds and move focus to the clip name, **Enter** mimics, **Shift+Enter** mimics and plays, **Esc** clears the selection before closing the window.

### Fixed

- Clicking **Start listening** dropped keyboard focus out of the Mimic window, so its keys did nothing until you clicked back in. The shortcuts now work as long as the window is open.

### Verified

- The opt-in live-relay guest test ran for the first time against real public relays and passed, including a new check that guests receive the host's transcript as text. All 4 live-relay tests pass.
- New e2e test for the keyboard flow.

## 2.5.0 — Mimic transcripts

**Update both the website (refresh) and the Windows companion** to use transcripts. Everything from 2.4 keeps working with a 2.4 companion. The previous release, `v2.4.0`, stays available; see [docs/ROLLBACK.md](docs/ROLLBACK.md).

### Added

- **Live transcript in the Mimic window.** The companion transcribes the rolling buffer locally with Whisper (`base.en`, the same model and filters as Voice Replay Studio). Lines appear a few seconds after they are spoken; click one to select exactly that audio. The words become the clip's default name.
- Host-only **Get transcripts (148 MB, once)** button. It downloads the model in the background with progress, then turns transcripts on. An existing Voice Replay Studio model on the same PC is reused.
- `SoundpadWeb.exe --transcribe-file <wav> [--download] [--verbose]` diagnostic.
- Tests: transcript chunking and timing (C#), transcript helpers (unit), and an e2e test that clicks a transcript line and clips it.

### Changed

- Mimic capture moved from NAudio's obsolete `WasapiCapture`/`WasapiLoopbackCapture` to its `WasapiRecorder`. One code path now serves both outputs and apps, and the CI warnings are gone.
- The companion embeds Whisper's native libraries (~2 MB) and writes them to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SoundpadWeb\native\` on first use, so it stays a single EXE. Whisper.net cannot find native libraries inside a single-file app on its own.

### Fixed during development

- A model download that succeeded but failed to load afterwards was deleted, forcing another 148 MB download. Downloads are now kept.

## 2.4.0 — Mimic

Soundpad Web and the separate **Voice Replay Studio** ("Mimic") project are now one repository. **Update both the website (refresh) and the Windows companion** to use Mimic; everything else still works with a 2.3 companion. To go back, see [docs/ROLLBACK.md](docs/ROLLBACK.md). The last pre-Mimic version is `v2.3.1` (tag `backup/pre-mimic`).

### Added

- **Mimic window.** The host chooses an app or output device, and the companion keeps the last 30 seconds in memory. Anyone allowed can select a moment on a live waveform and turn it into a Temp sound, or **Mimic & play** it immediately. See [docs/MIMIC.md](docs/MIMIC.md).
- **Mimic on** badge in every participant's header while capture runs.
- **Guest Mimic** permission (off by default). Only the host can choose or change the source.
- Voice Replay Studio V1.1 source imported unchanged under `mimic/`, with its README, tests and licenses. CI now builds it.
- `SoundpadWeb.Harness.exe --mimic-probe` checks real capture on a PC without saving audio.
- Tests: 5 companion tests, 4 unit tests and 2 e2e tests (one opt-in live-relay) for Mimic.

### Changed

- Companion version 2.4.0. Mimic is the only feature that needs it.
- The list of slow commands (longer timeouts) is shared between the companion bridge and the guest session instead of being copied in both.

### Fixed during development

- A selection near the left edge of the window was always refused as "scrolled out", because the buffer held exactly the visible 30 seconds. The buffer now keeps 15 extra seconds.
- Right after Mimic started, any selection that reached before the start of recording was refused; it is now trimmed to the recorded part.

## Unreleased (2.3.x)

- CI: browser tests retry once on GitHub Actions. A retried test is flagged as flaky in the run's public annotations, so intermittent failures are visible without downloading logs. An intermittent failure seen on the 2.3.1 `main` run did not reproduce in 144 later runs (72 local, 72 on CI).

## 2.3.1

First release maintained by Claude (Claude Code). The companion EXE is rebuilt as 2.3.1 so it matches the release tag, but its code is unchanged: a running 2.3.0 companion keeps working, and there's no need to download the new one.

### Fixed

- The `/` search shortcut no longer fires while the layout, organize-sound or statistics dialogs are open.
- Closing a dialog now returns keyboard focus to the button that opened it.
- Tab no longer escapes dialogs that contain dropdowns (the focus trap now includes `select`, `textarea` and `tabindex` elements).
- Dragging from inside a dialog (for example, while cropping an icon) and releasing over the backdrop no longer closes the dialog.
- The header badge read "V2" while the footer read "v2.3". Both now show the version from `package.json`.
- In the host layout, "All sounds" or a Soundpad category stayed highlighted after switching to My Layout.
- "Copy Invite" before the session finished starting said the clipboard was unavailable; it now says the session is still starting.
- Some notifications showed a raw `Error:` prefix and were styled as info instead of errors.
- Searching in My Layout now ignores leading and trailing spaces, as it already did in the host layout.
- "1 sounds" / "1 matching sounds" pluralization.

### Added

- Escape clears the search box.
- Unit tests for board sorting, personal folders, hidden sounds, search and the companion version gate.
- An end-to-end test for dialog focus handling, the search shortcut and backdrop clicks.

### Changed

- `main.tsx` was split from about 1,100 lines into `Sidebar`, `SettingsDialog`, `Modal` and a pure `arrange.ts` module. Permission toggles are now one table instead of six copy-pasted blocks.
- Hidden-sound filtering uses a `Set` instead of a linear scan for every sound.
- The companion version check and the 12-guest limit are each defined once (`version.ts`, `network/session.ts`).
