# Changelog

Notable changes to Soundpad Web. Versions follow the website's `package.json`; the Windows companion is versioned separately and only needs updating when a release says so.

## 2.3.1

First release maintained by Claude (Claude Code). The companion EXE is rebuilt as 2.3.1 so it matches the release tag, but its code is unchanged: a running 2.3.0 companion keeps working, and there's no need to download the new one.

### Fixed

- The `/` search shortcut no longer fires while the layout, organize-sound or statistics dialogs are open.
- Closing a dialog now returns keyboard focus to the button that opened it.
- Tab no longer escapes dialogs that contain dropdowns (the focus trap now includes `select`, `textarea` and `tabindex` elements).
- Dragging from inside a dialog (for example, while cropping an icon) and releasing over the backdrop no longer closes the dialog.
- The header badge read "V2" while the footer read "v2.3". Both now show the version from `package.json`.
- In the host layout, "All sounds" or a Soundpad category stayed highlighted after switching to My Layout.
- "Copy Invite" before the session finished starting said the clipboard was unavailable; it now says the session is still starting.
- Some notifications showed a raw `Error:` prefix and were styled as info instead of errors.
- Searching in My Layout now ignores leading and trailing spaces, as it already did in the host layout.
- "1 sounds" / "1 matching sounds" pluralization.

### Added

- Escape clears the search box.
- Unit tests for board sorting, personal folders, hidden sounds, search and the companion version gate.
- An end-to-end test for dialog focus handling, the search shortcut and backdrop clicks.

### Changed

- `main.tsx` was split from about 1,100 lines into `Sidebar`, `SettingsDialog`, `Modal` and a pure `arrange.ts` module. Permission toggles are now one table instead of six copy-pasted blocks.
- Hidden-sound filtering uses a `Set` instead of a linear scan for every sound.
- The companion version check and the 12-guest limit are each defined once (`version.ts`, `network/session.ts`).
